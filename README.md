Component Functionality
This HTML file sets up a basic React application with JSX and Babel integration. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the functionality:

Purpose: The component is designed to display a product page for a watch, featuring images, a description, features, and product details. It also includes an "Add to Cart" button and delivery information.

HTML Structure: The page is divided into several sections:

Product Image and Title: Displays an image of the watch, a title, price, and a detailed description.
Features: Lists the key features of the watch in two columns.
Product Details: Provides detailed specifications of the watch.
Cart Button and Delivery Information: Includes a button to add the item to the cart and delivery information.
React Integration:

Component: The App function is a React functional component that returns JSX. It includes HTML elements and React components, demonstrating the use of fragments (<> ... </>) to group elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
Rendering: The component is rendered into a <div> with the ID root using ReactDOM.
